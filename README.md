# Top Hits on Spotify (2000-2010s)

# Introduction
This project is a collaboration between three classmates to analyze the top 2000 hits from 2000s and 2010s on Spotify. Our goal was to predict the relationship between the music tempo, acousticness, and popularity, and to identify the dominant music genres in the dataset.

# Predictions
We hypothesized that higher correlation would indicate popularity with high tempo and low correlation would indicate popularity with high acousticness. We also predicted that Hip Hop and Pop would be the dominant music genres among popular songs in this dataset.

# Visualizations
We used a scatter plot, pie chart, and bar graph to showcase our data.

# Findings
Our analysis revealed the following:

* No correlation between popularity and acousticness
* Among the most popular songs, Pop is the dominant genre
* Outlier songs with high acousticness and high popularity are pop songs
* The dataset skews towards high popularity and low acousticness
* The two most prevalent genres are Pop and Hip-hop

# Conclusion
In conclusion, Pop and Hip-hop are the most popular genres among the top 2000 hits on Spotify from 2000s and 2010s. The data suggests that there is no correlation between popularity and acousticness, and outlier songs with high acousticness and high popularity are Pop songs.

# Interesting Observations
The data could be subjective as Spotify determines the genre of each track based on information from listener playlists (title, description, etc.) and their music curation teams.

# Future Improvements
To improve the accuracy of the analysis, we could obtain genre information from other sources and compare it with the dataset obtained from Spotify.

# Group Presentation
During the presentation, all group members spoke, and the presentation was well-prepared and relevant to the material. We used visually clean and professional slides that effectively demonstrated the project and maintained audience interest.

# Visualizations
We used six visualizations of data, including a scatter plot, pie chart, and bar graph. We ensured that all the images were labeled clearly and accurately, and we supported them with ample and precise explanation.

# Slide Deck
Our slides were relevant to the material, clear, and maintained audience interest. They effectively demonstrated the project and were visually clean and professional.

# Conclusion
Overall, our project analyzed the relationship between music tempo, acousticness, and popularity, identified the dominant music genres, and showcased the data using various visualizations.
